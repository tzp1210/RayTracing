# RayTracing
This is a toy ray tracer written when I finished reading Chapter 4 of Fundamentals of computer graphics.

Currently, this program support several functions:
* Blinn-Phong lighting model
* Shadow
* Ideal Specular Reflection
* Two kinds of primitives can be used to form a model: Sphere and Triangles.



In the further versions of this program, these functions will be added in the future:
* Modify class Light to enable several kinds of lighting model
* Make the program can load models from files
* Further beautify the rendering results
